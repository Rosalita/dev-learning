[10 yrs of doing BDD wrong part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EM4itu7j7I)

Synopsis: The word should encourages debate and constant questioning of the application which is being developed. When we have these conversation, we embrace uncertainty. Removing the work test keeps you in the problem space rather than jumping to the solution space. Pixie driven development, if forget about code and replace everything with placeholder pixies, get something that's easy to use instead of something that's easy to build. BDD scenarios are not user stories. Deliberate discovery, if you can focus on learning, you will go faster. We don't notice our ignorance, we don't know what we don't know. For deliberate discovery, we need to step away from the tools. If in doubt, try get something live, early. There's nothing like being 'wrong' to find people to tell you what 'right' looks like. BDD is writing software that matters.
