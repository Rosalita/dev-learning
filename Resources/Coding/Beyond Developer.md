[Beyond Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYEk0y8LYfg)

Synopsis: I am a developer, in a team, building a product, on a platform, in a department, in an organisation. A developer learns the language,  the libraries, monitors the alternatives, learns the toolchain, engages with the community. Understand the process, understand the roles, collaborate with all the others, attend to the teams health. Understand the business objective, studies the domain, knows all the stakeholders (the people who's lives we touch by doing work), contributes to the product. Shake off the shackle of requirements come at us and we are told what to do. Being told what to do and having things happen to you is being at effect. Be at cause, contribute to the product. Understand the technical landscape, understand the paths to production, care about run time concerns, value automation but not all the automation, contribute to the platform. In a department, understand the wider trade offs, share all knowledge across the team, contribute to the department, influence across the organisation. In an organisation, project the organisation's values, care about the organisation's reputation, share knowledge, have a multiplying effect by sharing knowledge to a wider audience outside the organisation, contribute to the organisation. If you want to go fast, go alone if you want to go far, go together.
