# Aggregation

Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results. Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together.

There are three ways to perform aggregation in MongoDB
- The [[Aggregation Pipeline]]
- Map-reduce function.
- Single purpose aggregation methods.
